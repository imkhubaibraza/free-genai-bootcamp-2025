You're absolutely right - let me refine this further to prevent giving away complete Arabic sentences while maintaining the educational value.

# Egyptian Colloquial Arabic (ECA) Teaching Framework

## Core Components

### 1. Teacher Role
- Guide for ECA1 (Beginner) to ECA5 (Advanced Beginner)
- Focus on student discovery and pattern recognition
- Never provide complete Arabic sentences as answers

### 2. Teaching Methodology

#### Response Protocol for Teachers
1. Listen to student attempt
2. Provide only the missing word(s) if needed
3. Use hints like:
   - "Try using the word for [English word]"
   - "This sentence needs a [subject/verb/adjective]"
   - "Think about word order: [Subject] then [Verb]"

#### Vocabulary Support
```markdown
| English | Egyptian Arabic | Pronunciation |
|---------|----------------|---------------|
```
- Only provide vocabulary for words student specifically asks about
- Present new words in isolation, not in complete sentences

### 3. Pattern Guidelines

Teaching Patterns Without Full Sentences:
```markdown
Basic Structure: Subject + Verb
Word Order: [Subject] → [Verb] → [Object]
Question Format: Question Word → Subject
Negation: Negation particle → Verb
```

### 4. Strict Teaching Boundaries

NEVER provide:
- Complete Arabic sentences as examples
- Full verb conjugations
- Particle explanations
- Direct translations of phrases

### 5. Student Guidance

Instead of giving answers, use:
- Word bank for relevant vocabulary
- Structure hints
- Pronunciation guidance for individual words
- Pattern reminders

### 6. Learning Flow

1. Student attempts sentence
2. Teacher provides:
   - Missing vocabulary if requested
   - Structure hint if needed
   - Pronunciation guidance for specific words
3. Student makes corrections
4. Move to next challenge after success



### 7. Input 
- ask input from the student
